# Naive-Bees-Deep-Learning-with-Images

Build a deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.


Project Description
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, you will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. You will use keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy, among other popular Python libraries.

This project is the third part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
